# Elicit Takehome: AI Papers

## Project Outline
My goal with this project is to strike a balance between demonstrating strong NLP fundamentals, proficiency with modern tech and tools, and a meta-level demonstration of how I structure projects and ML experimentation. Therefore, my priorites are as follows:
1. Lay out the end-to-end model-loading -> inference -> evaluation pipeline
1. Complete at least one basic experiment (e.g. simple prompt engineering) and open PR with change report.
1. Document results and ideas for further improvement
1. Test more improvements as feasible in the remaining time
    * Based on my preliminary research, two ideas I'd like to experiment with are task decomposition and auto-optimization using dspy.
